## Roadmap

Based on the success of `shopware2vuestorefront` integration Shopware and Divante are working together on the next version of enhanced, native and dedicated PWA for Shopware. It will be Open Source (MIT) and will be released in **Q2 2020**.

This project is no longer actively supported by Vue Storefront. It **will remain available open source**, however we recommend using the official Shopware PWA, powered by Vue Storefront, which is currently being build. More information can be found on [FAQ](FAQ.md).

# How to try it?

Feel free to check out. In order to have the Neto PWA up and running on Your local host You need to install the Vue Storefront first.

## Install Vue Storefront
Please do install the [Vue Storefront](https://docs.vuestorefront.io/guide/installation/linux-mac.html#requirements) using the official Installer. Make Sure that Vue Storefront is running with the default demo database on `http://localhost:3000`

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront.git vue-storefront
cd vue-storefront
yarn
yarn installer
```

## Download the Indexer and Api Extension
Vue Storefornt integration always requires two steps.

### First - Integrate the Dynamic Requests calls
... requests like user login, shopping cart synchronization must find out the way to Your Neto backend. Vue Storefront API is in charge of sending these requests and all You need is to setup the Shopware connector in it.

Download a [*.zip with the content of this](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/shopware2vuestorefront/archive/master.zip) repository (`vsf-api-extension` and `vsf-shopware-indexer`) and unpack the folders in the same parent directory Your `vue-storefront` and `vue-storefront-api` folders are located.

```
cd ..
wget https://github.com/DivanteLtd/shopware2vuestorefront/archive/master.zip
unzip master
```

Then, copy the content of `vsf-api-extension/*` to `vue-storefront-api/src/platform/shopware` 

```
mkdir vue-storefront-api/src/platform/shopware
cp vsf-api-extension/* vue-storefront-api/src/platform/shopware/
```

Change the `vue-storefront-api/config/local.json` setting the `platform` to `shopware`.
In the end - set the `Neto` API credentials in the `vue-storefront-api/config/local.json`.

Example shopware credentials inside `vue-storefront-api/config/local.json`
```json
...
"shopware": {
     "imgUrl": "",
     "assetPath":"",
     "magentoUserName": "",
     "magentoUserPassword": "",
     "httpUserName": "",
     "httpUserPassword": "",
     "api": {
         "url": "https://yourshop.biz/api",
         "accessToken": "SWxxxxxxxxxxxxxG"
     },  
     "url":"https://yourshop.biz"
}
...
```


### Second - Configure indexer and index the products, categories and other static elements

The second part of the integration is product's catalog which should be indexed into ElasticSearch index - which is the local database Vue Storefront is using in order to display the product catalog.

Follow the instructions located in vsf-shopware-indexer/README.md and then move to the next steps:

Now, please do configure the `vsf-shopware-indexer` by copying the `vsf-shopware-indexer/config.js.dist` to `vsf-shopware-indexer/config.js` and setting the proper API credentials.
9. Install the dependencies: `cd vsf-shopware-indexer/; yarn install`
8. Now You need to index Your local ElasticSearch index with the products from Shopware instance by running the:

```sh
node vsf-shopware-indexer/cli.js reindex attribute
node vsf-shopware-indexer/cli.js reindex category
```
Take a look for the attributes' IDs (for instance: color and size), and put them into `vsf-shopware-indexer/config.js` in the map section, adn then: 

```sh
node vsf-shopware-indexer/cli.js reindex product
```

Then make sure You applied the proper data schema on Your brand-new Elastic index by running the:
`cd vue-storefront-api; yarn db rebuild`

## Restart Your Vue Storefront

Kill all Your node processes with the `killall node` (in order to apply the config changes).
Run the `yarn dev` command in both: `vue-storefront-api` and `vue-storefront` folders.

Please do [contact us](https://vuestorefront.io) in the case of any issues with the installation procedure.
